# Digit recognition from simple to hard
with no third-party libraries, on poor Java.

The complexity level of the neural network algorithm is divided into different branches.
* stage_0 - the simplest algorithm for determining the numbers 0 and 1 in a 3x3 grid.
* stage_1 -  recognition of numbers 0 to 9 in a 3x5 grid with fixed weights and biases.
* stage_2 -  recognition of numbers 0 to 9 in a 3x5 grid with prior training and trained weights (biases optionally).
